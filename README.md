# Introduction to Predictive Analytics Projects:

Hello! 

This repository showcases a semester worth of projects my team and I have completed from my Predictive Analytics Class.
Throughout this class we have completed multiple machine learning and data analysis projects, each focused on solving real-world problems using advanced techniques, we solved these using Python or R.
1.	Time Series Analysis of Canadian Gas Data
o	This project analyzes the canadian_gas dataset using techniques like STL decomposition, SEATS, and X-11 decomposition. Key tasks include identifying an appropriate Box-Cox transformation, exploring seasonality, creating a seasonally adjusted series, and comparing decomposition methods to understand trends and seasonal patterns.
3.	Loan Prediction for Universal Bank
o	Using the Universal Bank dataset, this project employs k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification to predict whether a customer will accept a personal loan offer. It includes data partitioning, standardization, tuning the value of k, and generating confusion matrices to evaluate model performance across training, validation, and test sets. A specific customer profile is classified to demonstrate practical application.
4.	Support Vector Machine Models for Gas Mileage Prediction
o	This project utilizes the auto.csv dataset to classify cars as achieving high or low gas mileage. A binary variable is created based on the median gas mileage, and SVMs are trained with various kernels (linear, radial, and polynomial) and hyperparameters (C, gamma, degree). Cross-validation errors are evaluated, and relevant visualizations are generated to assess model performance and support findings.
Each project emphasizes practical applications of machine learning and statistical techniques, with detailed analyses and visualizations to provide insights into data patterns and model performance.
